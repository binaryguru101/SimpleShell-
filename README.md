# SimpleShell-
SimpleShell Project
This project involves creating a SimpleShell, a basic command-line shell that interacts with the user. The shell continuously:

Waits for user input.
Executes the command entered by the user.
Repeats the process until terminated using Ctrl-C.
The pseudocode for the implementation was inspired by Lecture 06 and Lecture 07 slides, which introduced key concepts in system call usage.

Key Features:
Execution: SimpleShell executes standard Unix commands provided by the user input.
System Calls: Explores and utilizes various system calls to manage process creation and execution.
Interactive: Runs in a loop, continuously accepting and processing commands.
Notes:
No implementation of individual Unix commands is required; the shell simply calls the appropriate system utilities.
This project is a foundational exercise in understanding shell behavior and system-level programming.
